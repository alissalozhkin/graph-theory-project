ubway systems are a very important mode of transportation. Subway systems provide many benefits, they are environmentally friendly, convenient, safer than other forms of transportation (e.g, cars) and cost effective. People use the subway for one reason, and that is to get to another place. And the majority of people want to get to their final destination in the fastest time possible. People can achieve this by planning. There is a clear relationship between the population size of a city and the complexity of the cityâ€™s subway. Areas with larger populations tend to have a greater number of subway stations. And as the subway becomes more and more complex, the harder it is for a subway user to plan their subway journey quickly. With this project, people will be able to plan their subway trips with ease and efficiency. This was done by examining two different subway systems. These subway systems served as a model when solving this problem, but the project is applicable to any other subway systems.
  
Finding the shortest path between subway stations is crucial to the overall experience of a subway user. Moreover, the complexity of large subway systems makes it difficult for the subway user to look at the system map and figure out the fastest route, especially if they want to avoid a station.  This project aims to provide subway users with the most efficient routes.
